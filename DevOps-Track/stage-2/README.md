# DevOps Stage 2: Dockerized Full Stack Web Application Deployment

In this stage, youâ€™ll deploy a provided full stack web application (React frontend and FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend) using Docker containers and proxy both services to run on the same port using Traefik or Nginx Proxy Manager.

## Requirements:

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Create a fork of this repository to add the necessary Docker and proxy configuration files.

2. **Dockerization**:
   - Write Dockerfiles to containerize both the React frontend and FastAPI backend. Ensure each service can be built and run locally in their respective containers.

3. **Configure Traefik, HaProxy or Nginx Proxy Manager** to:
   - Serve the frontend and backend on the same host machine port (80).
   - Serve the frontend on the root (/).
   - Proxy `/api` on the backend to `/api` on the main domain.
   - Proxy `/docs` on the backend to `/docs` on the main domain.
   - Proxy `/redoc` on the backend to `/redoc` on the main domain.

4. **Database Configuration**:
   - Configure the application to use a PostgreSQL database. Ensure the database is properly set up and connected.

5. **Adminer Setup**:
   - Configure Adminer to run on port 8080. Ensure Adminer is accessible via the subdomain `db.domain` and is properly connected to the postgres database.

6. **Proxy Manager Setup**:
   - Configure the proxy manager to run on port 8090. Ensure the proxy manager is accessible via the subdomain `proxy.domain`.

7. **Cloud Deployment**:
   - Deploy your Dockerized application to an AWS EC2 instance. Set up a domain for your application. If you don't have a domain, get a free subdomain from Afraid DNS. Configure HTTP to redirect to HTTPS. Configure www to redirect to non-www.

## Additional Instructions:
- There is a minimal README with simple instructions on starting the application in the repository. However, you are required to improve all the README files with well-detailed instructions on how to deploy the app, both manually and using Docker.

## Testing and Evaluation:
- Your hosted application will be tested to ensure it meets all the requirements. Your repository will be tested to ensure it works correctly after running `docker-compose up -d`.

## Submission Mode:
Submit your task through the designated submission form. Ensure you've:
- Double-checked all requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Provided a link to your deployed application and forked repository in the submission form.
- Thoroughly reviewed your work to ensure accuracy, functionality, and adherence to the specified guidelines before submission.

## Submission Deadline:
The deadline for submissions is Sunday, 7th July 2024, at 11:59 PM GMT.
