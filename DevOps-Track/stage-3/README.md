# DevOps Stage 3 Task

## Task: Messaging System with RabbitMQ/Celery and Python Application behind Nginx

### Objective:
Deploy a Python application behind Nginx that interacts with RabbitMQ/Celery for email sending and logging functionality.

### Requirements:

#### Local Setup:
1. Install RabbitMQ and Celery on your local machine.
2. Set up a Python application with the following functionalities:
   - An endpoint that can accept two parameters: `?sendmail` and `?talktome`.

#### Endpoint Functionalities:
- **?sendmail**: When this parameter is passed, the system should:
  - Send an email using SMTP to the value provided (e.g., `?sendmail=destiny@destinedcodes.com`).
  - Use RabbitMQ/Celery to queue the email sending task.
  - Ensure the email-sending script retrieves and executes tasks from the queue.
  
- **?talktome**: When this parameter is passed, the system should:
  - Log the current time to `/var/log/messaging_system.log`.

#### Nginx Configuration:
- Configure Nginx to serve your Python application.
- Ensure proper routing of requests to the application.

#### Endpoint Access:
- Use ngrok or a similar tool to expose your local application endpoint for external access.
- Provide a stable endpoint for testing purposes.

### Documentation and Walk-through:
- Record a screen-captured walk-through of the entire setup and deployment process.
- Ensure the video covers:
  - RabbitMQ/Celery setup.
  - Python application development.
  - Nginx configuration.
  - Sending email via SMTP.
  - Logging current time.
  - Exposing the endpoint using ngrok.
- Submit the endpoint and screen recording.


### Submission Requirements:
- Provide the ngrok (or equivalent) endpoint for testing.
- Submit the screen recording walk-through.
- Ensure all requirements are met and the application functions correctly.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Functionality:** All specified features must work correctly.
- **Clarity:** Code and configurations must be well-documented.
- **Presentation:** The screen recording should be clear and comprehensive.
- **Deadline Adherence:** Strict deadline, no late submissions accepted.
